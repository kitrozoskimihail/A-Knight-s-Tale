Short Game Review

The game A Knight’s Tale is an RPG developed in Unity and designed for play using a VR headset. It was developed and tested simultaneously using the Meta Quest 3.

The game consists of two levels. The first level features a medieval-style market. As players move through the market, training dummies appear, which are activated when the player crosses a certain threshold. Once activated, these dummies can be struck. After being hit, they return to their initial position. They contain a script that defines that if they come into contact with the collider attached to the player's sword, they will fall.

After completing the training course, or the first level, the second level loads. In the second level, enemies, specifically goblins, are placed throughout. The goblins have scripts for attacking, following the player and a health system. They also have their own animations for movement, taking and dealing damage, and dying.

When the goblins get close enough to the player, they begin to attack. All goblins, except for the last one—the boss—deal 1 HP (health point) of damage to the player with each hit, and all goblins have 3 HP. The player, on the other hand, has 10 HP. If the player loses all HP in battle, a Game Over scene appears, featuring a button to restart the level.

If the player defeats all the goblins and conquers the boss enemy, upon approaching the door behind the boss, the game is completed. At that point, a scene appears allowing the player to either restart the game or exit.

The game was made in a few days, together with my coleague Kliment Shukanov.
